Question 2 points and comments: 15/20
(-2) C: You should be more specific about what causes this output instead of
the other outputs. In this case, the child's signal handler executed before
the child's first print statement in line 20.
(-3) D: It is not true that the parent thinks the child has terminated; 
rather, the child signals the parent before the value of fork() is assigned
to forkret in the parent process. This is why forkret remains 0 during the
parent's signal handler.
