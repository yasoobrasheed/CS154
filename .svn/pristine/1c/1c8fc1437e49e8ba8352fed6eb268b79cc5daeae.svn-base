Grading revision: 16 

Comments: The project instructions state that your code will be evaluated using the dlc compiler.  
	    	dlc is automatically run as part of the driver.pl script, which was distributed to you.  
	    	Section 8 of the assignment describes the requirements for passing dlc compilation.
	    	The instructions indicated that the output of the driver.pl script would be your grade.
	    	The output of driver.pl applied to your code was an error.  This error has been converted to a grade of 0. 

$ make
gcc -O -Wall -lm -o btest bits.c btest.c decl.c tests.c
gcc -O -Wall -o ishow ishow.c

$ ./driver.pl

Final Grade: zapped

After manual fixes to compilation by instructor:

1. Running './dlc -z' to identify coding rules violations.
/usr/include/stdc-predef.h:1: Warning: Non-includable file <command-line> included from includable file /usr/include/stdc-predef.h.
dlc:bits.c:447:rotateLeft: Illegal operator (-)
dlc:bits.c:449:rotateLeft: Illegal operator (-)
dlc:bits.c:452:rotateLeft: Zapping function body!

Compilation Successful (1 warning)

2. Compiling and running './btest -g' to determine correctness score.
gcc -O -Wall -lm -o btest bits.c btest.c decl.c tests.c 
bits.c: In function ‘rotateLeft’:
bits.c:450:9: warning: unused variable ‘remove_leading_ones’ [-Wunused-variable]

3. Running './dlc -Z' to identify operator count violations.
/usr/include/stdc-predef.h:1: Warning: Non-includable file <command-line> included from includable file /usr/include/stdc-predef.h.
dlc:save-bits.c:447:rotateLeft: Illegal operator (-)
dlc:save-bits.c:449:rotateLeft: Illegal operator (-)
dlc:save-bits.c:452:rotateLeft: Zapping function body!

Compilation Successful (1 warning)

4. Compiling and running './btest -g -r 2' to determine performance score.
gcc -O -Wall -lm -o btest bits.c btest.c decl.c tests.c 
save-bits.c: In function ‘rotateLeft’:
save-bits.c:450:9: warning: unused variable ‘remove_leading_ones’ [-Wunused-variable]
     int remove_leading_ones = last_n & end_mask;
         ^


5. Running './dlc -e' to get operator count of each function.

Score = 76/103 [42/59 Corr + 34/44 Perf] (126 total operators)

Penalty for submitting non-compiling code: Lose points again for non-compliant functions
ezThreeFourths -3
isNonNegative -3
isPower2 -4
