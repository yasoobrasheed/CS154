Physical Addresses: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Processes P1, P2, P3 require only 1MB, 2MB, 3MB respectively
To Run a Process OS, needs a contiguous span of 3MB

1MB at adress 4 in use
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
F F F F X F F F F F

A. There is room for P1 in Addresses 0-2. 

1MB at adress 4 in use
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
1 1 1 F X F F F F F

B. There is room for P2 in Addresses 5-7.

1MB at adress 4 in use
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
1 1 1 F X 2 2 2 F F

C. There is no room for P3, because to run process 3, the OS needs a contiguous span of 3MB

D. Internal Fragmentation: 
   P1: 2MB (Process 1 takes 1 MB, but 3 are allocated contiguously by OS)
   P2: 1MB (Process 2 takes 2 MB, but 3 are allocated contiguously by OS)
   P3: N/A (Process 3 was not allocated by OS)
   Total: 3MB
E. External Fragmentation: 3MB (3 addresses are free (F))
