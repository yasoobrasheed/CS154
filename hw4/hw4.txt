A. After every cold miss for adding x[0][i] to the cache, there is a conflict 
   miss in the line, for adding x[1][i] to the cache. Thus the miss rate = 100%.

B. With a cache size of 1024, the only thing that changes is the set bit, so
   only the first cold miss is accounted for in the block offset. The miss rate
   is 25%.

C. With a two way set associative cache the bit offset remains the same but
   there are now 2 slots at every set, so the first x and y are cold misses but
   the next three are hits. Miss rate is 25%.

D. No, the number of blocks in a set remain the same when you increase the
   cache size, so there will still be the same number of cold misses.

E. Yes, a larger block size would help to reduce the miss rate because more
   elements would be able to fit into each set, so you'll be able to make more
   hits before the set index changes.

A. Latency = ((1 - R) * M * (FLD + FST)) + (R * H * (FLD + FST)) + (LBJ * FBJ) + (LAL * (1 - FBJ - FLD - FST))

B. Latency = ((1 - 0.6) * 120 * (0.22 + 0.12)) + (0.6 * 1 * (0.22 + 0.12)) + (3.0 * 0.2) + (1.1 * (1 - 0.20 - 0.22 - 0.12))
           = 18 cycles
